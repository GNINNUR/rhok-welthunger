	The "natural color" band combination. </b></br>
	Because the visible bands are used in this combination, ground features appear in colors 
	similar to their appearance to the human visual system, healthy vegetation is green, recently 
	cleared fields are very light, unhealthy vegetation is brown and yellow, roads are gray,
	and shorelines are white. This band combination provides the most water penetration 
	and superior sediment and bathymetric information. It is also used for urban studies. Cleared 
	and sparsely vegetated areas are not as easily detected here as in the 4 5 1 or 4 3 2 combination. 
	Clouds and snow appear white and are difficult to distinguish. Also note that vegetation 
	types are not as easily distinguished as the 4 5 1 combination. The 3 2 1 combination does 
	not distinguish shallow water from soil as well as the 7 5 3 combination does.
