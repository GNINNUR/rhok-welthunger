	This combination of near-IR (Band 4), mid-IR (Band 5) and red (Band 3) offers added definition 
	of <b>land-water boundaries</b></br> and highlights subtle details not readily apparent in the visible bands alone. 
	Inland lakes and streams can be located with greater precision when more infrared bands are used.
	With this band combination, vegetation type and condition show as variations of 
	hues (browns, greens and oranges), as well as in tone. The 4,5,3 combination demonstrates
	moisture differences and is useful for analysis of soil and vegetation conditions.
	Generally, the wetter the soil, the darker it appears, because of the infrared absorption capabilities of water.
