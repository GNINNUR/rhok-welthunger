	The standard "false color" composite.
	</b>
	</br>
	Vegetation appears in shades of red, urban areas are cyan blue, and soils 
	vary from dark to light browns. Ice, snow and clouds are white or light cyan.
	Coniferous trees will appear darker red than hardwoods. This is a very popular band combination 
	and is useful for vegetation studies, monitoring drainage and soil patterns and various stages of crop growth.
	Generally, deep red hues indicate broad leaf and/or healthier vegetation while lighter
	reds signify grasslands or sparsely vegetated areas. Densely populated urban areas are shown in
	light blue. This TM band combination gives results similar to traditional color infrared aerial photography.
