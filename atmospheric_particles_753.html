	This band combination also provides a<b> "natural-like" rendition</b> while also <b>penetrating atmospheric 
	particles, smoke and haze</b>.</br>
	Vegetation appears in shades of dark and light green during the growing 
	season, urban features are white, gray, cyan or purple, sands, soils and minerals 
	appear in a variety of colors. The almost complete absorption of Mid-IR bands in water, 
	ice and snow provides well defined coast lines and highlighted sources of water within 
	the image. Snow and ice appear as dark blue, water is black or dark blue.
	Hot surfaces such as forest fires and volcano calderas saturate the Mid-IR bands 
	and appear in shades of red or yellow. One particular application for this combination 
	is monitoring forest fires. During seasons of little vegetation growth the 7 4 2 
	combination should be substituted. Flooded areas should look very dark blue or black, 
	compared with the 3 2 1 combination in which shallow flooded regions appear gray and are difficult to distinguish.
