	while also penetrating atmospheric particles and smoke. Healthy vegetation will be a bright 
	green and can saturate in seasons of heavy growth, grasslands will appear green, pink
	areas represent barren soil, oranges and browns represent sparsely vegetated areas. Dry 
	vegetation will be orange and water will be blue. Sands, soils and minerals are highlighted
	in a multitude of colors. This band combination provides striking imagery for desert regions.
	It is useful for geological, agricultural and wetland studies. 
	If there were any fires in this image they would appear red.
	This combination is used in the fire management applications for post-fire
	analysis of burned and non burned forested areas.

	Grasslands appear as light green.
	The light-green spots inside the city indicate grassy land cover - parks, cemeteries, golf courses.
