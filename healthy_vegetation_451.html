	Healthy vegetation:</b></br>
	Healthy vegetation appears in shades of reds, browns, oranges and yellows.
	Soils may be in greens and browns, urban features are white, cyan and gray, 
	bright blue areas represent recently clearcut areas and reddish areas show new vegetation
	growth, probably sparse grasslands. Clear, deep water will be very dark in
	this combination, if the water is shallow or contains sediments it would appear 
	as shades of lighter blue. For vegetation studies, the addition of the 
	Mid-IR band increases sensitivity of detecting various stages of plant 
	growth or stress; however care must be taken in interpretation if acquisition
	closely follows precipitation. Use of TM 4 and TM 5 shows high reflectance in healthy
	vegetated areas. It is helpful to compare flooded areas and red 
	vegetated areas with the corresponding colors in the 3 2 1 combination to assure 
	correct interpretation. This is not a good band combination for studying cultural
	features such as roads and runways.
